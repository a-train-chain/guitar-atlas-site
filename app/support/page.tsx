            triggers a short cooldown, so wait a minute before trying again.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="Is my Guitar Atlas account the same as my Pedal Steel Atlas account?">
            Yes. The two apps share one account — one sign-in works in both,
            and a single Atlas Pro subscription covers both.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="What’s free, and what needs Atlas Pro?">
            Exploring stays free, including the full chord finder. Every new
            account starts with a 14-day free trial of Atlas Pro, which unlocks
            creating and saving your own content.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="I’m a student — do I have to pay?">
            No. If you join your teacher&rsquo;s studio with their invite code,
            you&rsquo;re covered by their subscription for as long as your
            membership is active. You never need to buy Atlas Pro separately.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="How do I manage or cancel Atlas Pro?">
            Subscriptions bought on iPhone, iPad, or Mac are billed by Apple.
            Manage or cancel them in your device&rsquo;s Settings, under your
            Apple Account &rarr; Subscriptions. Cancelling stops future billing;
            your subscription stays active until the end of the current period.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="How do I delete my account?">
            Open <strong>Profile</strong> and choose{" "}
            <strong>Delete Account</strong>. This permanently removes your
            account and your content. Because the account is shared,{" "}
            <strong>this also deletes your Pedal Steel Atlas data</strong>. The
            action can&rsquo;t be undone. You can also email us to request
            deletion.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="My teacher can’t see my progress.">
            Progress shows up once you&rsquo;ve opened the assigned piece,
            lesson, or course from your own library. Make sure you&rsquo;re
            online, and that your studio membership is still active — if your
            teacher paused it, your assignments stop updating until it&rsquo;s
            resumed.
          </FAQ>

          <FAQ q="Does it work offline?">
            Practice sessions, saved scales and chords, and pieces you&rsquo;ve
            already loaded work offline. Atlas Chat and adding new content need
            a connection.
